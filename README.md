## Description

Built a responsive landing page for RatePunk. Utilized Tailwind CSS for high customizability and design, Next.js for its robust features, and TypeScript for strong typing. The form uses react-hook-form and validator for form validation, storing the last entered email via JSONBIN. 

The codebase is formatted with Prettier, ensuring consistent code style across the project, enhancing readability, and reducing the chance of introducing errors.
